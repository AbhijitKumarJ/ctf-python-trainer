# Problem Statement: AI-Powered Python Trainer Application for Beginners and Python Newcomers

**Objective:**  
Develop a “Python Trainer” application that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to create tailored training plans and practice tasks for beginners and experienced programmers new to Python. The app will dynamically generate detailed learning milestones and practice exercises, track user progress, and adjust tasks based on past performance to bring users up to an intermediate level of Python proficiency.

## Application Requirements

### 1. Personalized Learning Plan Creation
- The application will start by gathering user information through a series of questions, assessing:
  - **Programming Experience Level:** No programming experience or experienced programmer new to Python.
  - **Python Experience Level:** Novice or Beginner.
  - **Learning Goals:** E.g., "Learning Python to build small applications," "Learning Python to transition from another language," "Learning Python to understand programming fundamentals," etc.
  - **Preferred Learning Style:** Hands-on projects, step-by-step instructions, or solving coding challenges.
  - **Frequency of Checkpoints/Milestones:** Weekly, bi-weekly, or custom intervals.
- Based on this information, the app will generate a customized training plan using an LLM. Each milestone will include:
  - **Milestone Name** (e.g., "Python Essentials and Core Constructs").
  - **Objective** (e.g., "Develop foundational knowledge of Python's basic syntax, control structures, and data types").
  - **Topics to Cover** (e.g., "Python data types, control structures, functions, and file handling").
- The training plan will be formatted and saved to disk as a structured document (e.g., JSON or text file) for the user to reference.

### 2. Incremental Practice Task Generation
- After the training plan is created, the app will generate a practice task for the first milestone. The task will be formulated with clear instructions, measurable objectives, and reminders to follow Python best practices.
- For subsequent milestones, the app will analyze the user’s past performance and dynamically adjust the practice task. If a user has struggled with a particular concept, the app will:
  - Include additional hints, step-by-step instructions, and resources for extra guidance.
  - Offer additional sub-tasks or exercises to reinforce the previous learning concepts.

### 3. Enforcement of Best Practices
- All practice tasks generated by the app will adhere to the following best practices:
  - **Virtual Environments:** Always use `python -m venv` to create a virtual environment for each practice task.
  - **Library Management:** Use a `requirements.txt` file for managing library dependencies only when a task requires the use of external libraries not included in the standard Python library.
  - **Output Requirements:** Each practice task should have clearly defined outputs that can be shared with the trainer app for validation and feedback.

### 4. Project Setup and Management
- The user will create a Python project on their system and specify the root folder to the app.
- The app will store this information, as well as the user's progress and state, ensuring that it can pick up where the user left off during subsequent sessions.

### 5. Guided Learning and Adaptive Feedback
- After the user completes a milestone, the app will automatically generate the practice task for the next milestone.
- As the user works through tasks, the app will monitor progress and offer adaptive feedback based on previous task completion quality. This might include additional prompts, learning resources, or encouraging messages to keep the user motivated.

### 6. State Persistence and Restoration
- The app will maintain and persist all relevant user data, including the current milestone, past performance, and the user's learning path.
- Each time the user starts the app, it will restore the state from the previous session, enabling a seamless and continuous learning experience.

## Key Considerations
- The application should use an intuitive interface to facilitate user interactions and ensure smooth communication with the LLM.
- The generated learning plans should be tailored specifically for beginners or those transitioning from other programming languages, with a focus on achieving an intermediate level of Python proficiency.
- The app should not execute user code directly but rely on user-provided outputs for task validation and feedback.

This Python Trainer app will offer an engaging, supportive, and personalized learning experience that leverages AI to help users quickly and effectively build foundational Python skills.
