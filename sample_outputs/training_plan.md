# Python Training Plan

## Background

Given the user's experience as an experienced programmer but new to Python, the training plan is designed to leverage their existing programming knowledge, allowing them to quickly grasp Python's unique features and paradigms. The focus is on hands-on learning, using practical exercises and projects to reinforce the core syntax, data types, and control flow of Python. The plan emphasizes building small projects to solidify understanding, culminating in a command-line task tracker project that integrates various skills learned throughout the month. By prioritizing practical application over theoretical concepts, the user will develop the confidence to independently create simple applications by the end of the training period.
