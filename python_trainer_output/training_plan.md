# Python Training Plan

## Background

This training plan is designed for an experienced programmer who is new to Python and aims to build a solid foundational understanding of the language within one month. Given the user's programming background, the plan emphasizes practical, hands-on learning with a focus on coding exercises and projects. The final goal is to enable the user to create a command-line task tracker, which will require knowledge of Python's core syntax, data types, control flow, and file handling. The milestones are structured to progressively build skills and confidence, ensuring that by the end of the month, the user can independently develop simple applications.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Introduction to Python Syntax
