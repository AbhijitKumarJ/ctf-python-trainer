# Practice Task

# Practice Task: Data Analysis Application

## Introduction
In this milestone task, you will create a comprehensive data analysis application using Flask and Pandas. This project will allow you to integrate your knowledge of web development, data handling, and data visualization. By the end of this task, you will have a functional web application that can upload datasets, analyze them, and visualize the results.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Up the Project
- **Create a new project directory**: 
  ```bash
  mkdir data_analysis_app
  cd data_analysis_app
  ```

- **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  ```

- **Install required packages**:
  ```bash
  pip install Flask pandas matplotlib
  ```

- **Create the main Python script file**:
  - Name the file `app.py`.

- **Create additional files**:
  - `templates/` directory for HTML files.
  - `static/` directory for CSS and JavaScript files (optional).
  - Create an HTML file named `index.html` inside the `templates/` directory.

### 2. Detailed Requirements
- **Flask Application**:
  - Set up a basic Flask application in `app.py`.
  - Create a route for the home page that renders `index.html`.

- **File Upload**:
  - Implement a file upload feature that allows users to upload CSV files.
  - Use Flask's `request` object to handle file uploads.

- **Data Handling with Pandas**:
  - Once a file is uploaded, read the CSV file using Pandas.
  - Perform basic data analysis (e.g., summary statistics, data cleaning).

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Use Matplotlib to create visualizations based on the uploaded data.
  - Display the visualizations on the web page.

- **User Interface**:
  - Create a simple user interface in `index.html` that includes:
    - A file upload form.
    - A section to display the analysis results.
    - A section to display the generated visualizations.

### 3. Expected Output or Behavior
- When the application is run, users should be able to:
  - Access the home page.
  - Upload a CSV file.
  - View summary statistics of the data.
  - See visualizations generated from the data (e.g., bar charts, line graphs).

### 4. Hints or Tips for Completing the Task
- Use Flask's `render_template` function to render HTML files.
- Make sure to handle file uploads securely (e.g., check file extensions).
- Use Matplotlib's `savefig` function to save visualizations as images and display them in the HTML.
- Test your application with different CSV files to ensure it handles various data formats.
